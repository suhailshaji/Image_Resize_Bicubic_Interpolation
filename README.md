<h1> Image Resize Bicubic Interpolation </h1>
Image resizing is a crucial concept that wishes to augment or reduce the number of pixels in a picture. Applications of image resizing can occur under a wider form of scenarios: transliteration of the image, correcting for lens distortion, changing perspective, and rotating a picture. The results of resizing greatly vary looking on the kind of interpolation algorithm used.
<h2>What is Interpolation?</h2>
Interpolation works by using known data to estimate values at unknown points. For example: if you wanted to understand the pixel intensity of a picture at a selected location within the grid (say coordinate (x, y), but only (x-1,y-1) and (x+1,y+1) are known, youâ€™ll estimate the value at (x, y) using linear interpolation. The greater the quantity of already known values, the higher would be the accuracy of the estimated pixel value.
